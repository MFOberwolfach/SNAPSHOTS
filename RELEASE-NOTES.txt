release v3.0.0
==============

changes
-------
* Option \creditsversionone removed. All snapshots are printed

    indicate plural explicitely in case of more than one junior
    editor as explained in template.tex.
* French is supported to allow translations into French.
* The cleveref package is prefered over autoref and therefore
    loaded and used in template.tex.
* An example on how to cite a snapshot was added to the references of
    tempate.tex.
* template.tex contains hints for writing a good snapshot.
* Default senior editor in template.tex updated.
* Spacing of the footnote marks improved. \footnotewithoutspace added
    for footnotes following punctuation marks.

release v2.1.1
==============

feature
-------
* two or more junior editors are handled better now
as explained in template.tex.

documentation
-------------
* optional argument of \begin{abstract}
template.tex has been changed, such that the sample text is 
unlikely to make it into the final document.


release v2.1.0
==============

features
--------
* logo band update
The Leibniz Association changed their logo slightly by introducing
a line break after the word Leibniz. Version 2 of the logo band
has been changed accordingly. Version 1 of the logo band is left
unchanged.

* autoref names with ngerman
The words "section", "Figure", etc. printed by \autoref are
tacitly translated when \usepackage[ngerman]{babel} is present
in the preamble.


release v2.0.0
==============

notes
-----
Many thanks to everyone who contributed to this release by
suggesting improvements or by providing code!

Version 2.0.0 is downwards compatible in the sense that snapshots,
that can be compiled with v1.2.0 and possibly earlier versions of
snapshotmfo.cls can be compiled with v2.0.0, too. However, the
result will look different as the credits - and maybe more -
have changed. 

Compile testsuite/data/test-template.tex to see which warnings
should remain and which should not. For details see
testsuite\README.txt.


features
--------
* credits updated
Snapshots submitted before 2017 must have \creditsversionone in
the latex file. By default snapshots are now printed with an
updated credits text and without the logos of the Klaus Tischra
Foundation and the Oberwolfach Foundation.

* altered latex package trackchanges.sty added
An improved version of trackchanges.sty has been added to the
repository. The use of the package must be activated if needed.
Being in the same directory as the latex file it precedes files of
the same name that possibly come with the latex installation.

* latex package mathtools added in template.tex
The use of the package must be activated if needed.

* latex package wrapfig added in template.tex
The use of the package must be activated if needed.

* two or more junior editors are handled properly now
as explained in template.tex.

* overfullrule for proofreading added in template.tex
The line must be activated as needed.

* top level pdf bookmark added
This yields a proper bookmarks - or table of contents - tree
when the snapshot pdf is incorporated into another pdf file.


added directories and files
---------------------------
* "testsuite" directory added
The use of the test suite is optional. It contains numerous unit
tests in the form of latex files and some scripts to simplify the
testing. See testsuite/README.txt for details.


documentation
-------------
* comments on references improved
In template.tex the different ways to supply bibliographical
references are explained in more detail now.

* release notes added
Comments on the previous releases were
included in the e-mail announcements and on 
https://github.com/MFOberwolfach/SNAPSHOTS/releases 

* README.md updated
The credits text from snapshotmfo.cls and the corresponding
passage from README.md should always stay identical.


fixed bugs
----------
* double slashes for mailto fixed
The e-mail addresses in mailto references in the pdf output were
preceded by two slashes.

* warning "DOI changed" fixed
For a snapshot number greater than or equal to 100 the warning
"snapshot number has changed" remained forever.

* warning "Connection to other fields changed" fixed
The warning remained forever in german snapshots connected to
the field "Betrachtungen über Mathematik".

* option of figure environment updated
The option h was replaced by ht to get rid of the respective
warning.


known bugs
----------
* Entering umlauts as utf-8 characters works in normal text, but
not in \junioreditors and similar control sequences.
On the other hand, \"a, \"o, etc. works everywhere.

* Using a tilde in \junioreditors, e.g. in Walter~Becker, yields
a hyperref warning, but produces correct output: a non-breakable
space in the pdf and an ordinary space in the pdf metadata.

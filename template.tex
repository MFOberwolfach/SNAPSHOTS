%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BIBLIOGRAPHY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% There are three ways to provide your references:
%%% 
%%% 1. by using the embedded .bib file:
%%%    * replace the references below by your own ones
%%%    * and leave the \bibliography command at the end of this file unchanged.
%%% This is the default way as it is a full-fledged BibTex solution
%%% while you have to edit only one file.
%%% 
%%% 2. by using a separate .bib file:
%%%    * provide your own .bib file,
%%%    * delete everything from \begin{filecontents} until \end{filecontents}
%%%    * and make the \bibliography command at the end of this file point to your .bib file.
%%% 
%%% 3. by using no BibTeX at all:
%%%    * delete everything from \begin{filecontents} until \end{filecontents}
%%%    * replace the \bibliography command at the end of this file with the
%%%      thebibliography environment containing a \bibitem command for each reference.
%%% This way is deprecated as it is less flexible than the BibTeX solutions.

\begin{document}
%%% Starting with version 1.29 the LaTeX package "bookmark" doesn't create the title bookmark any more.
% As a workaround, please uncomment and edit the following line:
%\pdfbookmark{Your title (without math mode, control sequences and special characters)}{snapshottitle}
% The second argument "snapshottitle" is just an identifier and can be left unchanged.

%%% Please insert your abstract here. 
\begin{abstract}
This is your abstract. It should give a brief overview of your snapshot. If possible, please do not use formulas in your abstract. Please do not use more than 500 characters. 
\end{abstract}
%%% If necessary, use the optional argument to supply an alternative text for the pdf metadata, cf. the comment on \title above: 
%\begin{abstract}[This is a plain text equivalent of your abstract used for the pdf metadata. It should give a brief overview of your snapshot. Please do not use more than 500 characters.]
%This is your abstract containing math mode, TeX control sequences, or some special characters. It should give a brief overview of your snapshot. Please do not use more than 500 characters.
%\end{abstract}

%%% Please insert the main body of your snapshot here.
\section{A heading}
%%% If necessary, use the optional argument to supply an alternative text for the pdf bookmark, cf. the comment on \title above: 
%\section[Optional plain text substitute]{A heading containing math mode, for example}

Your actual snapshot.\footnote{This is a footnote.} As usual, you can give references such as \cite{knuth1984texbook, wikiMath, sample13, sample12, sample11, sample14} via the \verb+\cite+ command.

We appreciate if you include images or other graphics that illustrate your snapshot. However, please do keep in mind the copyright issues explained in our email in case you include images and graphics you have not produced yourself.

%%% Please use this format to include images. Supported image formats: jpg, pdf, png. Please convert your images to those formats.

\end{figure}

\subsection{A subsection}
%%% If necessary, use the optional argument to supply an alternative text for the pdf bookmark, cf. the comment on \title above: 
%\subsection[Optional plain text substitute]{A heading containing math mode, for example}
More text and some formulas:
\begin{align}\label{real}
1+1&=2,\\\label{char.2}
1+1&=0.
\end{align}
Formula \eqref{real} refers to $\mathbb{R}$, Formula \eqref{char.2} does not.

\section{Comment on this unit test}
The snapshot template has been interspersed with editing by Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave. Look for colors and footnotes.

Ordinary footnotes and trackchanges footnotes both are numbered consecutively, but independently of each other,
througout the whole document as 1, 2, 3, \dots\ and c1, c2, c3, \dots, respectively.
See test-hyperref.tex for footnotes in special places like section headings.

Latex should write the line
\begin{verbatim}
trackchanges.sty    2023/03/10 v0.7.0-mfo3 TrackChanges file
\end{verbatim}
with this date and version number to standard output. Otherwise \LaTeX has not loaded the version updated by the MFO snapshots team.

%%% Please insert the main body of your snapshot here.
\section{A heading}
Your actual snapshot.\hskip -.1em\footnote{This is a footnote.} As usual, you can give references such as \cite{knuth1984texbook, wikiMath, sample13, sample12, sample11, sample14} via the \verb+\cite+ command.

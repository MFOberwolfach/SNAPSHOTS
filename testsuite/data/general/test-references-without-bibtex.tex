\begin{abstract}
The description of this test is given in the first section. The other section demonstrates this way of providing references.
\end{abstract}

\section{Comment on this unit test}
We choose the third way to provide bibliographical references as explained in template.tex:
\begin{verbatim}
There are three ways to provide your references:

[...]

3. by using no BibTeX at all:
 * delete everything from \usepackage{filecontents} until
   \end{filecontents},
 * replace the \bibliography command at the end of this file with
   the thebibliography environment containing a \bibitem command
   for each reference.
This way is deprecated as it is less flexible than the BibTeX
solutions.
\end{verbatim}

After two or more compilations of this file there should be no ``LaTeX'' or ``class snapshotmfo'' warnings.

\section{A heading}
Your actual snapshot.\footnote{This is a footnote.} As usual, you can give references such as \cite{knuth1984texbook, wikiMath, sample13, sample12, sample11, sample14} via the \verb+\cite+ command.\\

We appreciate if you include images or other graphics that illustrate your snapshot. However, please do keep in mind the copyright issues explained in our email in case you include images and graphics you have not produced yourself.

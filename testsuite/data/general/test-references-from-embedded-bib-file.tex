\begin{abstract}
The description of this test is given in the first section. The other section demonstrates this way of providing references.
\end{abstract}

\section{Comment on this unit test}
We choose the first way to provide bibliographical references as explained in template.tex:
\begin{verbatim}
There are three ways to provide your references:

1. by using the embedded .bib file:
   * replace the references below by your own ones
   * and leave the \bibliography command at the end of this file
     unchanged.
This is the default way as it is a full-fledged BibTex solution
while you have to edit only one file.

[...]
\end{verbatim}

After three or more compilations of this file there should be only one ``LaTeX'' warning.
Do not make the ``BibTeX'' warnings about ``empty language'' disappear by supplying a language,
unless you want it explicitely printed in the references!

As this is template.tex's default way to provide references, this test is covered by test-template.tex.

\section{A heading}
Your actual snapshot.\footnote{This is a footnote.} As usual, you can give references such as \cite{knuth1984texbook, wikiMath, sample13, sample12, sample11, sample14} via the \verb+\cite+ command.\\

We appreciate if you include images or other graphics that illustrate your snapshot. However, please do keep in mind the copyright issues explained in our email in case you include images and graphics you have not produced yourself.

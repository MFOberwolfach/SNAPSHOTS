%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BIBLIOGRAPHY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% There are three ways to provide your references:
%%%
%%% 1. by using the embedded .bib file:
%%%    * replace the references below by your own ones
%%%    * and leave the \bibliography command at the end of this file unchanged.
%%% This is the default way as it is a full-fledged BibTex solution
%%% while you have to edit only one file.
%%%
%%% 2. by using a separate .bib file:
%%%    * provide your own .bib file,
%%%    * delete everything from \begin{filecontents} until \end{filecontents}
%%%    * and make the \bibliography command at the end of this file point to your .bib file.
%%%
%%% 3. by using no BibTeX at all:
%%%    * delete everything from \begin{filecontents} until \end{filecontents}
%%%    * replace the \bibliography command at the end of this file with the
%%%      thebibliography environment containing a \bibitem command for each reference.
%%% This way is deprecated as it is less flexible than the BibTeX solutions.

%%%%%%%% If your latex file does not compile, please delete all .aux and .log files and try again. %%%%%%%
\begin{document}
%%% Starting with version 1.29 the LaTeX package "bookmark" doesn't create the title bookmark any more.
% As a workaround, please edit the following line:
\pdfbookmark{Your title (without math mode, control sequences and special characters)}{snapshottitle}
% The second argument "snapshottitle" is just an identifier and can be left unchanged.

%%% Please insert your abstract here.
\begin{abstract}
This is your abstract. It should hint at the storyline of your snapshot. Contrary to research articles, the abstract does not have to be a summary but is an advertisement for the reader to continue. For example, you can pose here a question and leave the answer to the main text. If possible, please do not use formulas in your abstract and keep it to less than 500 characters.
\end{abstract}
%%% If necessary, use the optional argument to supply an alternative text for the pdf metadata, cf. the comment on \title above:
%\begin{abstract}[This is a plain text equivalent of your abstract used for the pdf metadata. It should give the storyline of your snapshot. Contrary to research articles, this does not have to be a summary but something that catches the attention of a potential reader. For example, you can pose here a question and leave the answer to the text. Please do not use more than 500 characters.]

\section{Comment on this unit test: test-template.tex}
test-template.tex differs from template.tex only by this section!
After the following compilations
\begin{verbatim}
pdflatex test-template.tex
bibtex test-template.aux
pdflatex test-template.tex
pdflatex test-template.tex
\end{verbatim}
the following warnings will remain:
\begin{verbatim}
LaTeX Warning: Writing or overwriting file
`./test-template.bib'.

Class snapshotmfo Warning: No snapshot id given.
Class snapshotmfo Warning: No mathematical subject given.
Class snapshotmfo Warning: No connection to other fields given.
Class snapshotmfo Warning: No license information given.
Class snapshotmfo Warning: Unable to compute DOI.

Warning--empty language in sample14
Warning--empty language in sample11
Warning--empty language in helfgott14
Warning--missing pages in helfgott14
Warning--empty language in knuth1984texbook
Warning--empty language in sample12
Warning--empty language in sample13
Warning--empty language in wikiMath
\end{verbatim}

Using TeXnicCenter with MikTeX on Windows, the compilation summary will read:
\begin{verbatim}
LaTeX-Result: 0 Error(s), 8 Warning(s), 1 Bad Box(es), 5 Pages(s)
BibTeX-Result: 0 Error(s), 8 Warning(s)
\end{verbatim}

The ``overwriting file'' warning is inevitable as long as you provide the references the default
way, i.\,e. as an embedded .bib file.

The ``class snapshotmfo'' warnings will disappear as soon as you supply the expected information.

Do not make the ``empty language'' warnings disappear by supplying languages for the items,
unless you want the languages explicitely printed in the references!

There may be two extra ``class snapshotmfo'' warnings depending on the version of your
hyperref package:
\begin{verbatim}
Class snapshotmfo Warning: Unable to patch certain hyperref
commands (1). You can ignore this warning, if your hyperref
package's date is 2020-10-19 or newer. Otherwise please report
this to the maintainer of the snapshotmfo document class. on
input line 331.

Class snapshotmfo Warning: Unable to patch certain hyperref
commands (2). You can ignore this warning, if your hyperref
package's date is 2020-10-19 or newer. Otherwise please report
this to the maintainer of the snapshotmfo document class. on
input line 331.
\end{verbatim}


%%% Please insert the main body of your snapshot here.
\section{A heading}
%%% If necessary, use the optional argument to supply an alternative text for the pdf bookmark, cf. the comment on \title above:
%\section[Optional plain text substitute]{A heading containing math mode, for example}

This is the main text of your snapshot.\footnote{This is a footnote.} Here you develop the story of your snapshot.
How do you come up with a good idea for a snapshot?

Imagine your university organizes an ``open house'' and you want to give a talk to convince high school students to study with you. If you can touch on recent research in such a talk then it is also a great topic for a snapshot. Ideally, a snapshot has 5--8 pages, so you can necessarily explain only a small ``snapshot'' of your mathematical interests.

As usual, you can give references such as \cite{knuth1984texbook, wikiMath, sample13, sample12, sample11, sample14, helfgott14} via the \verb+\cite+ command.
We appreciate if you include images or other graphics that illustrate your snapshot. However, please do keep in mind the copyright issues explained in our email in case you include images and graphics you have not produced yourself.

%%% Please use this format to include images. Supported image formats: jpg, pdf, png. Please convert your images to those formats.

        \includegraphics[width= 0.33 \textwidth]{mfo.jpg}
        \caption{An image scaled to 33\% of the textwidth.}
\label{fig:sample-image}
\end{figure}

\subsection{A subsection}
%%% If necessary, use the optional argument to supply an alternative text for the pdf bookmark, cf. the comment on \title above:
%\subsection[Optional plain text substitute]{A heading containing math mode, for example}
More text and some formulas:
\begin{align}\label{real}
1+1&=2,\\\label{char.2}
1+1&=0.
\end{align}
Formula \eqref{real} refers to $\mathbb{R}$, Formula \eqref{char.2} does not.
